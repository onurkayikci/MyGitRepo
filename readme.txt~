Create a folder on your computer called 'ang-news'. In your terminal, navigate to that folder and then run the following command:

yo angular

This command scaffolds an AngularJS application in the current folder. After running yo angular, Yeoman will ask you a few questions regarding how you want to set up your application. Below are a list of the questions and their respective answers for this tutorial.

**[?] Would you like to use Sass (with Compass)? (Y/n)**

Answer 'n'. Sass is a great CSS framework and we recommend you use it. However, we aren't teaching you Sass/CSS in this tutorial and it can be a hassle to install (as it depends on Ruby and Bundler to be installed).

**[?] Would you like to include Twitter Bootstrap? (Y/n)**

Answer 'y'. For this tutorial, we are going to use the base CSS & HTML from Twitter Bootstrap, the front-end framework from Twitter. Yeoman will automatically include the latest version of Twitter Bootstrap in our project and create a demo page using Bootstrap's styling.

**[?] Which modules would you like to include? (Press <space> to select)**
press space for all of them
